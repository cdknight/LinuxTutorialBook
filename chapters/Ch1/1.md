## Why Use Linux Mint?

Linux Mint is a powerful, easy to use, and largely bug and frustration-free Linux distribution for desktop computers. It is faster than Windows in many cases, and offers  a polished, simple, and clean interface. Linux Mint comes in three variants, Linux Mint Cinnamon Edition (the default and flagship edition), featuring the Cinammon desktop environment, developed by the people who make Linux Mint, for mid-range to high-end computers, Linux Mint MATE, for lower-end computers and for a faster experience, and Linux Mint XFCE, for very low-end computers, or for making a high-end computer faster when performance really matters (like in a video editing studio).

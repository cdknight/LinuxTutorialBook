## 1.1 How Your Computer Boots Up

<use metro vibes dark>

Every computer made in the last ten years boots up very similarly, whether it runs Windows, or macOS, or Linux, or BSD. You'll notice I elaborate on Linux a lot more here since that is the focus of this book.

There is a low level component in every standard PC/Mac. This was once the BIOS, or **Basic Input-Output System**, and now there is the UEFI, standing for 
**Unified Extensible Firmware Interface**. Most computers made in the last 10 years (from 2018) have a UEFI.

Let's understand this diagram in detail. First of all, the UEFI (or BIOS) will start the bootloader, which is a file on a  partition<sup>1</sup> on the storage medium. Then, the bootloader lets you select/automatically starts the kernel based on its configuration.

Now, the **kernel** starts up. From the kernel, the **init**<sup>2</sup> program starts. Init starts and sets up important services and devices like wireless cards, graphics cards, and other services. You won't need to worry about init as a user but know what it is.

Next is the **display manager**. This is simply the login screen, known as **LightDM** on Linux Mint. You might have to worry about LightDM if there are broken upgrades. It may also be useful when installing new software.

After you log in, you are greeted by the **desktop environment**, which is simply the desktop where you use Linux Mint the most, launching programs, settings things up, and performing upgrades.

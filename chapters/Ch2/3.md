## 1.3 How Your Computer Handles Crashes

Almost every Linux distribution crashes the same way, and that is by either having a program crash in the desktop environment, or to have the kernel (the program that manages the hardware) to crash, usually due to driver issues. When the kernel crashes, it is called a **kernel panic**. **Kernel panics** can happen for many different reasons. Usually, they are caused by faulty drivers, but sometimes the kernel can have bugs and crash, but this is very rare, which is the reason that so many companies use Linux: because it very rarely crashes.

#### When Lock-Ups Happen

There are many reasons that lock-ups can happen in Linux distributions, and the number one cause is a lack of memory (RAM). A lack of RAM, which is the short term storage for your computer, can prevent applications from running correctly, and, with a legacy software called X, which is a very old protocol designed in the 1980s for displaying graphics (like your desktop), when one application crashes on your computer, your entire computer will lock up (this does not always happen an can be easily recovered from). With a newer protocol called **Wayland**, there is a reduced chance of lock-ups. In general, if too many applications are running with a low amount of RAM, then the computer will lock up quickly. Therefore, it is important to choose the correct Linux distribution for your computer.
